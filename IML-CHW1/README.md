# README for IML CHW1

## Project Overview

This assignment is part of the *Introduction to Machine Learning* course.  
The goal of this homework is to apply fundamental machine learning concepts on multiple real-world datasets, covering both supervised learning and data analysis tasks.

The project focuses on data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and interpretation of results using classical machine learning techniques.

The datasets included in this homework are:

- `IRIS.csv` – Standard dataset for classification tasks.
- `fake_news.csv` – Dataset for text-based classification.
- `artists.dat` – Metadata related to artists.
- `user_artists.dat` – User interaction dataset for recommendation-style analysis.

## Structure of the Assignment

The homework consists of multiple analytical and modeling tasks applied to different datasets.

### Part 1 – Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature normalization / scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Part 2 – Supervised Learning
- Implementation of classification models
- Training and validation
- Hyperparameter tuning (if required)
- Performance comparison between models

### Part 3 – Model Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Visualization of model performance

## Implementation Details

All implementations are done in:

- **Python**
- Jupyter Notebook environment

Main libraries used:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

The models are implemented either from scratch (when required) or using `scikit-learn` for comparison and validation.
